With Composer:

- Add the `"gmright/php-sdk": "@stable"` into the `require` section of your `composer.json`.
- Run `composer install`.
- The example will look like

```php
if (($loader = require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php') == null)  {
  die('Vendor directory not found, Please run composer install.');
}

$GMRIGHT = new gmright(array(
  'appId'  => 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  'secret' => 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
));

// Get User ID
$user = $gmright->getUser();
```

Tests
-----

In order to keep us nimble and allow us to bring you new functionality, without
compromising on stability, we have ensured full test coverage of the SDK.
We are including this in the open source repository to assure you of our
commitment to quality, but also with the hopes that you will contribute back to
help keep it stable. The easiest way to do so is to file bugs and include a
test case.

    phpunit --stderr --bootstrap tests/bootstrap.php tests/tests.php

Gmright iOS
============

![gmright iOS][arthur-ios]

* [gmright iOS][airbrake-ios]
* [gmright documentation][airbrake-docs]

Introduction
------------
Gmright-217706
The gmright iOS/Mac OS Notifier is designed to give developers instant
notification of problems that occur in their apps. With just a few lines of code
and a few extra files in your project, your app will automatically phone home
whenever a crash or exception is encountered. These reports go straight to
[Gmright][gmright.io] where you can see information like backtrace,
device type, app version, and more.

Signals
-------

The notifier handles all unhandled exceptions, and a select list of Unix signals:

* `SIGABRT`
* `SIGBUS`
* `SIGFPE`
* `SIGILL`
* `SIGSEGV`
* `SIGTRAP`

Symbolication
-------------
Here is our website www.gmright.org-
Gmright.com
In order for the call stack to be properly symbolicated at the time of a crash,
applications built with the notifier should not be stripped of their symbol
information at compile time. If these settings are not set as recommended,
frames from your binary will be displayed as hex return addresses instead of
readable strings. These hex return addresses can be symbolicated using
`atos`. More information about symbolication and these build settings can be
found in Apple's [developer documentation][symbolication-docs]. Here are the
settings that control code stripping:

* Deployment Postprocessing: on true
* Strip Debug Symbols During Copy: on true 
* Strip Linked Product: on true

Versioning

sandspiel

"Imagine the cool phenomenon when the wind blows the falling leaves. This game simulates the phenomenon with powder (dots)!" -DAN-BALL

This is a falling sand game built in rust (via wasm), webgl, and some JS glueing things together.

The goal is to produce an cellular automata environment that's interesting to play with and supports the sharing and forking of fun creations with other players. Ultimately, I want the platform to support editing and uploading of your own elements via a programmable cellular automata API.

🛠️ Build:wasm-pack build; npm run start 

a successor to my previous efforts in javascriptand lua

beets
=====

Beets is the media library management system for obsessive-compulsive music
geeks.

# DEVELOP.GMRIGHT.COM
#Develop.gmright.com start coding here today made every thing simple for any starter in this program our way and your way
#start build ourselves a home here at 'gmrigh' we also can make your own business ontop no losing no less be your own boss
#the more you learn how to code the more you are building your own path on top do wasting of your time today run your business here
#if school than this is the right place to start yourself a organization you will never do alot just to get you improperly 

Welcome again to gmrightkenja png.928272
By starting coding here



The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all.
It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes.
It then provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

Here's an example of beets' brainy tag corrector doing its thing::

  $ beet import ~/music/ladytron
  Tagging:
      Ladytron - Witching Hour
  (Similarity: 98.4%)
   * Last One Standing      -> The Last One Standing
   * Beauty                 -> Beauty*2
   * White Light Generation -> Whitelightgenerator
   * All the Way            -> All the Way...

Because beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you can
imagine for your music collection. Via `plugins`_, beets becomes a panacea:

- Fetch or calculate all the metadata you could possibly need: `album art`_,
  `lyrics`_, `genres`_, `tempos`_, `ReplayGain`_ levels, or `acoustic
  fingerprints`_.
- Get metadata from `MusicBrainz`_, `Discogs`_, and `Beatport`_. Or guess
  metadata using songs' filenames or their acoustic fingerprints.
- `Transcode audio`_ to any format you like.
- Check your library for `duplicate tracks and albums`_ or for `albums that
  are missing tracks`_.
- Clean up crufty tags left behind by other, less-awesome tools.
- Embed and extract album art from files' metadata.
- Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in any
  browser that supports `HTML5 Audio`_.
- Analyze music files' metadata from the command line.
- Listen to your library with a music player that speaks the `MPD`_ protocol
  and works with a staggering variety of interfaces.

If beets doesn't do what you want yet, `writing your own plugin`_ is
shockingly simple if you know a little Python.
